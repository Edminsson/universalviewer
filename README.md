# Universal Viewer Package
This repo is a fork of Universalviewer/Universalviewer.

The purpose is to make a npm package that only contains a distfolder.
The package is supposed to contain the National Archives of Sweden's
version of Universalviewer.

Since there is a npm package called Universalviewer we need to give our
package a unique name and a version number.

We add the file property to be able to specify the dist folder.

This package is published and can be installed:
npm install test-eduv
